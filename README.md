# Analyzing COVID-19’s impact on global mobility and economic indicators
Analyzing COVID-19’s impact on global mobility and economic indicators.

This project investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global mobility patterns and impacted key economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates, and industrial production. By integrating mobility data with economic statistics, the analysis provides insights into the pandemic's short- and long-term socioeconomic effects across different regions.

Objectives:
To analyze the changes in human mobility during various phases of the pandemic.

To correlate mobility trends with economic indicators like GDP, unemployment, and inflation.

To identify the sectors and countries most affected by movement restrictions and lockdowns.

To visualize the timeline of pandemic-related disruptions and recovery across regions.

To assess the effectiveness of government interventions (stimulus, lockdowns, vaccination drives).

Tools & Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python / R

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

Visualization Tools: Power BI / Tableau / Python Dashboards

Data Sources:

Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports

Apple Mobility Trends

World Bank and IMF Economic Data

OECD Stats

National Statistical Agencies

Key Steps in the Project:
1. Data Collection:
Aggregated mobility data from Google and Apple for different countries and time periods.

Collected economic indicators (GDP growth, unemployment rates, industrial output, inflation) from World Bank and OECD databases.

2. Data Cleaning & Transformation:
Harmonized different date formats and unified country naming conventions.

Normalized economic indicators for fair comparisons across countries.

Calculated percentage changes and deviations from pre-COVID baselines.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Tracked mobility trends across categories like workplaces, retail, parks, and transit stations.

Identified significant drops in mobility during lockdown periods.

Compared economic indicator fluctuations before, during, and after major COVID waves.

4. Correlation & Regression Analysis:
Analyzed correlations between mobility reductions and GDP contraction.

Built regression models to estimate the economic cost of mobility restrictions.

Studied lag effects of lockdowns on unemployment and business activity.

5. Visualization & Reporting:
Created interactive dashboards to show:

Country-level mobility vs. GDP plots

Timeline charts of pandemic waves vs. economic trends

Heatmaps of lockdown severity vs. economic impact

Highlighted regional variations in recovery patterns (e.g., Asia vs Europe vs Americas).

Findings & Insights:
There was a strong negative correlation between workplace mobility and GDP in Q2 2020.

Countries with strict, early lockdowns saw sharper short-term declines but often recovered faster.

Service-heavy economies (e.g., tourism-dependent countries) suffered deeper, longer-lasting impacts.

Recovery in mobility and economic activity was closely tied to vaccination rates and stimulus spending.

Informal sector workers and small businesses faced the highest economic stress.

Recommendations:
For future pandemics, balance between strict mobility control and economic support is crucial.

Develop real-time mobility and economic monitoring systems to guide policy responses.

Invest in digital infrastructure to support remote work and online commerce.

Support sectors most vulnerable to mobility restrictions with targeted aid.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the deep interconnection between public health measures and economic performance. By analyzing mobility and economic data side-by-side, it provides a comprehensive view of COVID-19's multidimensional impact and offers data-driven guidance for future crisis management.
